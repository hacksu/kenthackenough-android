# KHE Android app

## About
An Android app to be used with KHE using the API defined in [KentHackEnough](https://github.com/hacksu/kenthackenough/wiki). At this time, it implements a chat/update system with some notifications and a calendar of events.

## Todo

* Everything needs to be a bit more pretty, but in particular events need to have non-necessary information collapsable. 
* Events need location added
* Events need notifications implemented.
* All lists need proper push notification for updates.
* Implement community choice system.
* Dashboard needs implemented
